# Makefile — docker compose aliases for the local dev stack.
#
# Usage:
#   make up            bring the full stack up (detached)
#   make down          stop and remove containers
#   make restart       restart all services
#   make ps            list running services
#   make logs          tail logs for all services
#   make build         (re)build all service images
#   make rebuild       rebuild all service images without cache
#   make pull          pull base images
#   make dashboard     open the Gatus health dashboard in the browser
#   make test          run all Hurl integration suites (HTML report in `reports/`)
#   make up-<svc>      start one service:            `make up-kv`, `make up-cms`
#   make logs-<svc>    tail logs for one service:    `make logs-search
#   make test-<svc>    run one service's test suite: `make test-mempool`
#   make redis-cli     redis-cli into the shared redis container
